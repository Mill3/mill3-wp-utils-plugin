MILL3 WP utils, includes Gutenberg editor sidebar resizer.

== Description ==

MILL3 WP utils, includes Gutenberg editor sidebar resizer and many essential features and utils for our Boilerplate Theme

== How to update translations files (.pot, .mo, .po) ==

To update the main .pot file (.pot = PO Template file), open a Terminal window at the root of your website. (ex: /Desktop/wordpress-installation/).

```sh
docker-compose run wp-cli i18n make-pot wp-content/plugins/mill3-wp-utils-plugin wp-content/plugins/mill3-wp-utils-plugin/languages/mill3-wp-utils.pot --domain="mill3-wp-utils" --exclude="wp-content/plugins/mill3-wp-utils-plugin/vendor/"
```

To update a particular language, you need to install POEdit.
Then, go to */wp-content/plugins/mill3-wp-utils-plugin/languages/* and double-click on the .po file or the language you want to edit translations.
In POEdit, go to the Translation Menu -> Update from POT file... and choose the .pot file in */wp-content/plugins/mill3-wp-utils-plugin/languages/*.
Edit your translations and hit Save.

To translate this plugin into another language, you need to open */wp-content/plugins/mill3-wp-utils-plugin/languages/mill3-wp-utils.pot* in POEdit and
click on "Create new translation" at the bottom/left of this window.
